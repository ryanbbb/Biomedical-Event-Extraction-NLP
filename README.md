# Biomedical-Event-Extraction-NLP
Event extraction and classification using pretrained T5 transformer from Huggingface. Optimized with AdamW solver.

In this project I apply a T5 tokenizer and transformer in order to extract and events from biomedical text. The purpose of this project is to train a model on a topical corpus in order to extract a list of the key events and trigger words from each sentence. 

The dataset used is a labeled and annotated version of the GENIA dataset. The preprocessed dataset is available here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nishanthsalian/genia-biomedical-event-dataset
